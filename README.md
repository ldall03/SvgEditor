# Libraries Used
This was done using C# and Windows Forms. This project would not have been possible without the helpe of <a href="https://github.com/svg-net/SVG">SVG .NET</a>,
a powerful but simple library to handle svg graphics in C#. This other project: <a href="https://github.com/cdiggins/svg-editor">https://github.com/cdiggins/svg-editor</a> has been very useful as a skeleton and inspiration for the basic features of this program, it is also worth checking out!
